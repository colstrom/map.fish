#+TITLE: map.fish

* Overview

  ~map~ reads from =STDIN= and passes each line as arguments to =$argv=.

  This is quite similar to ~xargs~, but is usable with =functions= and
  =builtins=, where ~xargs~ expects =commands=. ~map~ works with =commands= as
  well, but lacks the options =xargs= has. This may be deirable or not,
  depending on your situation.
